After spending most of October, November and December not doing any riding I was nowhere\r\n                near\r\n                the shape I was in the summer, so to regain some fitness I fully committed myself to the Zwift 4 week\r\n                FTP\r\n                boosting plan. After a full month of riding almost everyday I saw my FTP increase from 240 watts\r\n                (3.7w/kg)\r\n                to 292 watts (4.5w/kg).</p>\r\n            <h2>A bit of Background</h2>\r\n            <p>There are two factors that probably contributed to my 50 watt gain. Firstly, although I didn’t do an FTP\r\n                test, based on how hard efforts felt, I’d estimate my FTP was around 275 in late September. Secondly I\r\n                spent most of October, November, and December rock climbing, so although my body weight had remained at\r\n                65kg my muscle was redistributed from my lower body to upper body.</p>\r\n            <h2>The Initial FTP Test</h2>\r\n            <p>I did the <a class=\"default\" href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/1327137053\">initial FTP test</a> on\r\n                Christmas day (before the big turkey) and managed to push out 260 watts for\r\n                20 minutes. The effort hurt in a way different to what I remembered FTP efforts feeling like. It was\r\n                mainly my lungs holding me back and although my legs felt like they could go a bit harder, my lungs felt\r\n                like they couldn’t take in enough oxygen and I was tasting blood in the back of my throat. It was\r\n                disappointing to see how much fitness I had lost in 3 months, but it motivated me to start riding again,\r\n                and I set a goal to get my FTP up to 270 watts by the end of the month long training block.</p>\r\n            <h2>Week 1</h2>\r\n            <p>Being a bit of an egomaniac I refused to believe how much fitness, so I immediately manually bumped my\r\n                FTP settings up to 250 to make the workouts harder. The first workout was incredibly hard and part of me\r\n                was wishing I had just kept the settings at 240, but I made it through in the end.</p>\r\n            <p>One of the first things I learned in the first week is that erg mode is useless for efforts less than 1\r\n                minute.</p>\r\n            <p>I was riding everyday, and sticking to the plan religiously but I had to shuffle the order of my rides\r\n                sometimes since I work 9am-5pm and have class from 7pm-10pm on Mondays and Wednesdays. This allowed me\r\n                to do the shorter rides on Monday and Wednesday and save the long rides for the other days. When you\r\n                only have an hour at home between work and class, a 45 minute workout at least gives you 15 minutes to\r\n                shower and get out the door.</p>\r\n            <h2>Week 2</h2>\r\n            <p>The workouts were still hard but I was feeling a bit better by the end of my efforts. So naturally I\r\n                raised the FTP setting up to 260 because feeling good, especially at the end of a workout is overrated.\r\n                The first workout after bumping up the settings hurt so much…as expected, and near the end I had that\r\n                nagging thought in my head again that I had bitten off more than I could chew. But, like last time I\r\n                managed to pull through and get to the end all while keeping the contents of my stomach, firmly in my\r\n                stomach (for the most part).</p>\r\n            <p>The rest of the week seemed to go by quickly although there were a couple of days where it took an\r\n                enormous amount of will-power just to plug in my trainer and launch Zwift. But, I new that the feeling\r\n                of regret if I missed a day would kill me, so I just sucked it up and rode.</p>\r\n            <h2>Week 3</h2>\r\n            <p>Another week, another 10 watts added to the FTP settings so I could feel like dying by the end of the\r\n                workout on the first day.
