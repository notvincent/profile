Despite averaging 10 watts less\r\n                than my previous 10 minute effort I was feeling terrible and was convinced I wouldn’t make it. I backed\r\n                off my power a bit and let the average drop down to 305. In the last 3 minutes I was suffering in ways I\r\n                haven’t suffered before, my right arm was going numb, and I was fighting to hold back my vomit.</p>\r\n            <p>When I crossed the line I had nothing left in me, but when I ended the ride to see my new FTP at 292\r\n                watts, I couldn’t help but smile and feel relieved that all the pain over the past 4 weeks was worth it.\r\n                I’m only 21 so I have a lot of life left to experience, but that moment alone in my basement, dripping\r\n                in sweat was one of the best so far.</p>\r\n            <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>\r\n            <p>Riding almost everyday is not only logistically challenging, but also mentally exhausting. During the month I was only climbing once a week and I did notice a bit of loss of upper body strength (especially while looking in the mirror). I’m now moving onto my next training block which will be focused more on endurance and will probably only be 4-5 rides a week but more volume. I’m also looking forward to being able to dedicate some more time to climbing.</p>\r\n            <p>If you want to see how my endurance training is going follow me on <a class=\"default\" href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/5114942\">Strava</a>.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    export default {\r\n        name: \"FtpBooster\"\r\n    }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped lang=\"scss\">\r\n    @import \"blog.scss\";\r\n\r\n</style>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FtpBooster.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FtpBooster.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./FtpBooster.vue?vue&type=template&id=5e7ed059&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./FtpBooster.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./FtpBooster.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./FtpBooster.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=5e7ed059&scoped=true&lang=scss&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"5e7ed059\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\ncomponent.options.__file = \"FtpBooster.vue\"\nexport default component.exports"],"sourceRoot":""}
