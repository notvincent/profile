At the beginning of the\r\n                summer Evan and I were supposed to do an attempt in Collingwood, but we both\r\n                ended up getting busy and plans fell through (or maybe this is just an excuse\r\n                and in reality, we were too scared). Then one weekend in the fall we started to\r\n                toss around the idea of doing a virtual Everesting attempt, and fully committed\r\n                to the plan when we realized no one has Everested on Innsbruck giving us the\r\n                opportunity to get our names in the <a class=\"default\" href=\"https://everesting.cc/\">everesting.cc </a>hall\r\n                of fame board.</p>\r\n            <h2>Chunk 1: 0-2388m</h2>\r\n            <p>I woke up at 6:00am despite my\r\n                alarm being set to 6:30 in anticipation of the day ahead of me. Took my morning\r\n                pee, then weighed in at 67.5kgs…the heaviest I’ve been in the past 6 months. I\r\n                decided I better shed some more weight, so I went back to the washroom, and\r\n                after 5 minutes weighed in at 67.2kgs; good enough (I’ll leave it to the\r\n                imagination of the reader what happened in that washroom).</p>\r\n            <p>At 7am we queued up the Lord of the\r\n                Rings extended edition trilogy and got to pedaling. The first rep I did an easy\r\n                218 watts, but for some reason my heart rate was up at 140 bpm…not a good sign\r\n                at the very start of the day. However, the reps ticked by and 3 bottles of\r\n                Gatorade and 12 cookies later, we had done 6 reps and it was time for the first\r\n                break (throw the pogo sticks in the microwave).</p>\r\n            <h2>Chunk 2: 2388-4378m</h2>\r\n            <div class=\"image-container\">\r\n                <img src=\"../../assets/blogs/everesting/everesting_5hrs_deep.jpg\">\r\n            </div>\r\n            <p>Most people choose to sleep in on Saturdays\r\n                and don’t get out of their beds and hop on their bikes at 7am. The rest of the\r\n                world seemed to wake up during this chunk because I got a few “What are you\r\n                doing today let’s hangout” messages…No I’m busy. Aside from the occasional\r\n                message interrupting my focus, this chunk was largely spent watching Legolas\r\n                fight off orcs while I tried my best to ignore my legs and heart rate. Another\r\n                2 bottles of Gatorade and 12 cookies brought us to the second break, 11 reps in\r\n                and almost half way. Time for some fried dumplings, something I’ve been\r\n                craving since the start of rep 7.</p>\r\n            <p>Having Evan there riding with me at this\r\n                point was key, had I been on my own I probably wouldn’t have gotten back on the\r\n                bike. In the back of my head I knew that if I gave up I’d be letting us both\r\n                down. So, after the 30 minute break I took a deep breath and got back on the\r\n                saddle</p>\r\n            <h2>Chunk 3: 4378-5970m</h2>\r\n            <p>More Gatorade, more welches. My stomach was\r\n                beginning to start to feel like it had just drunk a gallon of Gatorade…probably\r\n                because I had just drunk a gallon of Gatorade. Maybe my nutrition wasn’t going as\r\n                smoothly as I would like, but that’s what I get I guess for buying Pogo sticks\r\n                as a race day food. My mind was also not quite up to the task and I was just waiting\r\n                for Evan to say “that’s enough” so I could jump on the opportunity and call it\r\n                a day. However, the only words coming out of Evan’s mouth at the time where him\r\n                reciting Aragorn’s “<a class=\"default\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzvAAAHVFBI\">ride out with\r\n                    me</a>” speech during the battle of Helm’s\r\n                Deep.</p>\r\n            <h2>Chunk 4: 5970-7960m</h2>\r\n            <p>At this point I was too invested in the task\r\n                at hand to give up. My stomach hadn’t settled and my legs where hurting, but at\r\n                least they’d been hurting the same amount for the last 3 hours, so I’ll take\r\n                that as a positive. We passed Everest base camp 1,2, and 3 in this chunk which\r\n                was a bit of moral victory. Despite it literally being an uphill battle from\r\n                here on out, by the end of this chunk I felt we were on the metaphorical\r\n                downhill.</p>\r\n            <h2>Chunk 5: 7960-8848m</h2>\r\n            <p>The final stretch, and the smallest chunk.\r\n                On the final ascent Evan opened it up heading up at a cool 4w/kg and being the\r\n                kind of person who hates getting dropped I followed. Then on one of the steep\r\n                sections after the village, I decided to take up the pace making and just go as\r\n                hard as I could, averaging an even cooler 4.8w/kg up the rest of the climb. The\r\n                craziest part is that the segment ended up taking 20 minutes, and I almost\r\n                matched my best 20-minute power from last season (just goes to show how much\r\n                you can improve in a year). By the top we only had a couple more meters to\r\n                gain before we hit the magic 8848m. We descended one last time and I almost\r\n                couldn’t contain the excitement, when the elevation reading finally ticked to\r\n                the height of Everest all I could do was smile (mainly because I didn’t have\r\n                the energy for any extreme emotions).</p>\r\n            <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>\r\n            <p>What I learned.
