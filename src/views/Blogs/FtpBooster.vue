            <h1>From 3.7 w/kg to 4.5 w/kg in a Month</h1>
            <p>At the beginning of this winter I finally jumped onto the Zwift hype train and invested in an Elite Rampa
                Smart trainer. After spending most of October, November and December not doing any riding I was nowhere
                near
                the shape I was in the summer, so to regain some fitness I fully committed myself to the Zwift 4 week
                FTP
                boosting plan. After a full month of riding almost everyday I saw my FTP increase from 240 watts
                (3.7w/kg)
                to 292 watts (4.5w/kg).</p>
            <h2>A bit of Background</h2>
            <p>There are two factors that probably contributed to my 50 watt gain. Firstly, although I didn’t do an FTP
                test, based on how hard efforts felt, I’d estimate my FTP was around 275 in late September. Secondly I
                spent most of October, November, and December rock climbing, so although my body weight had remained at
                65kg my muscle was redistributed from my lower body to upper body.</p>
            <h2>The Initial FTP Test</h2>
            <p>I did the <a class="default" href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1327137053">initial FTP test</a> on
                Christmas day (before the big turkey) and managed to push out 260 watts for
                20 minutes. The effort hurt in a way different to what I remembered FTP efforts feeling like. It was
                mainly my lungs holding me back and although my legs felt like they could go a bit harder, my lungs felt
                like they couldn’t take in enough oxygen and I was tasting blood in the back of my throat. It was
                disappointing to see how much fitness I had lost in 3 months, but it motivated me to start riding again,
                and I set a goal to get my FTP up to 270 watts by the end of the month long training block.</p>
            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <p>Being a bit of an egomaniac I refused to believe how much fitness, so I immediately manually bumped my
                FTP settings up to 250 to make the workouts harder. The first workout was incredibly hard and part of me
                was wishing I had just kept the settings at 240, but I made it through in the end.</p>
            <p>One of the first things I learned in the first week is that erg mode is useless for efforts less than 1
                minute.</p>
            <p>I was riding everyday, and sticking to the plan religiously but I had to shuffle the order of my rides
                sometimes since I work 9am-5pm and have class from 7pm-10pm on Mondays and Wednesdays. This allowed me
                to do the shorter rides on Monday and Wednesday and save the long rides for the other days. When you
                only have an hour at home between work and class, a 45 minute workout at least gives you 15 minutes to
                shower and get out the door.</p>
            <h2>Week 2</h2>
            <p>The workouts were still hard but I was feeling a bit better by the end of my efforts. So naturally I
                raised the FTP setting up to 260 because feeling good, especially at the end of a workout is overrated.
                The first workout after bumping up the settings hurt so much…as expected, and near the end I had that
                nagging thought in my head again that I had bitten off more than I could chew. But, like last time I
                managed to pull through and get to the end all while keeping the contents of my stomach, firmly in my
                stomach (for the most part).</p>
            <p>The rest of the week seemed to go by quickly although there were a couple of days where it took an
                enormous amount of will-power just to plug in my trainer and launch Zwift. But, I new that the feeling
                of regret if I missed a day would kill me, so I just sucked it up and rode.</p>
            <h2>Week 3</h2>
            <p>Another week, another 10 watts added to the FTP settings so I could feel like dying by the end of the
                workout on the first day. Just kidding…I kept the 260 watt setting from the previous week, maybe it was
                because I was still finding the workouts difficult, or maybe it was because I was growing soft.</p>
            <p>At this point I had run out of new years motivation and the main reason why I stuck with the plan was
                fear of being dropped by friends on rides in the summer. It felt like I had been riding a lot but I’d
                only been putting in 7 hours a week which is less than what I would normally do in the summer. That
                realization made things seem a bit more manageable and made the training plan seem a bit less
                mental.</p>
            <h2>Week 4</h2>
            <p>This was the final week so I bumped the FTP settings on the workouts up to 270, with hopes of if I could
                do these workouts it meant my FTP was somewhere near 270. This week actually had a rest day which I
                scheduled to Friday so I could go to a bar and do some carb loading with friends. I also added an
                additional rest day on Monday so I wouldn’t have to worry about the timing of my night class.</p>
            <p>One of the sessions before the FTP test includes a 10 minute max effort to help you gauge what your 20
                minute effort might be. I averaged 320 watts for 10 minutes and felt really good at the end, so I was
                super psyched and realized I would probably be able to blow my 270 watt goal out of the water.</p>
            <h2>The FTP Test</h2>
            <p>When the day came to finally do the <a class="default"
                                                      href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1383924699">FTP test</a>
                the Zwift course was London so I had to go into the Zwift
                config file and change the course to Watopia since I wanted to go up a mountain for extra motivation. My
                initial goal was to increase my FTP to 270, but after that 10 minute effort at 320 watts I was getting
                greedy and wanted to do 310 watts for the 20 minutes.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the FTP effort, I was really struggling to find a rhythm and appropriate gearing. It
                felt like I was either doing 350 watts at 80 rpm or 300 watts at 105 rpm but this was probably a mental
                thing more than anything. At the 10 minute mark a message pops up on the screen saying you’re halfway
                there and to add 10 more watts if you feel good. I did not feel good. Despite averaging 10 watts less
                than my previous 10 minute effort I was feeling terrible and was convinced I wouldn’t make it. I backed
                off my power a bit and let the average drop down to 305. In the last 3 minutes I was suffering in ways I
                haven’t suffered before, my right arm was going numb, and I was fighting to hold back my vomit.</p>
            <p>When I crossed the line I had nothing left in me, but when I ended the ride to see my new FTP at 292
                watts, I couldn’t help but smile and feel relieved that all the pain over the past 4 weeks was worth it.
                I’m only 21 so I have a lot of life left to experience, but that moment alone in my basement, dripping
                in sweat was one of the best so far.</p>
            <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
            <p>Riding almost everyday is not only logistically challenging, but also mentally exhausting. During the month I was only climbing once a week and I did notice a bit of loss of upper body strength (especially while looking in the mirror). I’m now moving onto my next training block which will be focused more on endurance and will probably only be 4-5 rides a week but more volume. I’m also looking forward to being able to dedicate some more time to climbing.</p>
