            <h1>Everesting Innsbruck - Pushing the Limit</h1>
            <p>The thought of riding up a mountain
                for 20 minutes may sound unpleasant for many people, so how would they react if
                you told them you’re doing 23 reps up said 20-minute mountain. After 12 hours,
                7250 calories my roommate <a class="default"
                                             href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/4619234?oq=eva">Evan</a> and I
                completed our 23<sup>rd</sup> rep
                of the <a class="default" href="https://www.strava.com/segments/18389384?filter=overall">Zwift world championship reverse KOM </a>and ticked over the magic
                8848m of elevation gain in one ride: the height of Everest.</p>
            <h2>What is Everesting?</h2>
            <p>Everesting has become a term coined
                by cyclists which refers to gaining 8848m of elevation in one ride. To put into
                perspective how much of a challenge this is, Alpe d’Huez has a total elevation
                gain of 1135m, so Everesting on the Alpe would take 9 reps (most of us would be
                more than satisfied doing 1 rep).</p>
            <h2>The Idea</h2>
            <p>The initial thought of Everesting
                has been in the back of my head for about a year now. At the beginning of the
                summer Evan and I were supposed to do an attempt in Collingwood, but we both
                ended up getting busy and plans fell through (or maybe this is just an excuse
                and in reality, we were too scared). Then one weekend in the fall we started to
                toss around the idea of doing a virtual Everesting attempt, and fully committed
                to the plan when we realized no one has Everested on Innsbruck giving us the
                opportunity to get our names in the <a class="default" href="https://everesting.cc/">everesting.cc </a>hall of fame board.</p>
            <h2>Chunk 1: 0-2388m</h2>
            <p>I woke up at 6:00am despite my
                alarm being set to 6:30 in anticipation of the day ahead of me. Took my morning
                pee, then weighed in at 67.5kgs…the heaviest I’ve been in the past 6 months. I
                decided I better shed some more weight, so I went back to the washroom, and
                after 5 minutes weighed in at 67.2kgs; good enough (I’ll leave it to the
                imagination of the reader what happened in that washroom).</p>
            <p>At 7am we queued up the Lord of the
                Rings extended edition trilogy and got to pedaling. The first rep I did an easy
                218 watts, but for some reason my heart rate was up at 140 bpm…not a good sign
                at the very start of the day. However, the reps ticked by and 3 bottles of
                Gatorade and 12 cookies later, we had done 6 reps and it was time for the first
                break (throw the pogo sticks in the microwave).</p>
            <h2>Chunk 2: 2388-4378m</h2>
            <p>Most people choose to sleep in on Saturdays
                and don’t get out of their beds and hop on their bikes at 7am. The rest of the
                world seemed to wake up during this chunk because I got a few “What are you
                doing today let’s hangout” messages…No I’m busy. Aside from the occasional
                message interrupting my focus, this chunk was largely spent watching Legolas
                fight off orcs while I tried my best to ignore my legs and heart rate. Another
                2 bottles of Gatorade and 12 cookies brought us to the second break, 11 reps in
                and almost half way. Time for some friend dumplings, something I’ve been
                craving since the start of rep 7.</p>
            <p>Having Evan there riding with me at this
                point was key, had I been on my own I probably wouldn’t have gotten back on the
                bike. In the back of my head I knew that if I gave up I’d be letting us both
                down. So, after the 30 minute break I took a deep breath and got back on the
                saddle</p>
            <h2>Chunk 3: 4378-5970m</h2>
            <p>More Gatorade, more welches. My stomach was
                beginning to start to feel like it had just drunk a gallon of Gatorade…probably
                because I had just drunk a gallon of Gatorade. Maybe my nutrition wasn’t going as
                smoothly as I would like, but that’s what I get I guess for buying Pogo sticks
                as a race day food. My mind was also not quite up to the task and I was just waiting
                for Evan to say “that’s enough” so I could jump on the opportunity and call it
                a day. However, the only words coming out of Evan’s mouth at the time where him
                reciting Aragorn’s “<a class="default" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzvAAAHVFBI">ride out with me</a>” speech during the battle of Helm’s
                Deep.</p>
            <h2>Chunk 4: 5970-7960m</h2>
            <p>At this point I was too invested in the task
                at hand to give up. My stomach hadn’t settled and my legs where hurting, but at
                least they’d been hurting the same amount for the last 3 hours, so I’ll take
                that as a positive. We passed Everest base camp 1,2, and 3 in this chunk which
                was a bit of moral victory. Despite it literally being an uphill battle from
                here on out, by the end of this chunk I felt we were on the metaphorical
                downhill.</p>
            <h2>Chunk 5: 7960-8848m</h2>
            <p>The final stretch, and the smallest chunk.
                On the final ascent Evan opened it up heading up at a cool 4w/kg and being the
                kind of person who hates getting dropped I followed. Then on one of the steep
                sections after the village, I decided to take up the pace making and just go as
                hard as I could, averaging an even cooler 4.8w/kg up the rest of the climb. The
                craziest part is that the segment ended up taking 20 minutes, and I almost
                matched my best 20-minute power from last season (just goes to show how much
                you can improve in a year). By the top we only had a couple more meters to
                gain before we hit the magic 8848m. We descended one last time and I almost
                couldn’t contain the excitement, when the elevation reading finally ticked to
                the height of Everest all I could do was smile (mainly because I didn’t have
                the energy for any extreme emotions).</p>
            <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
            <p>What I learned. Pacing is everything and
                having a plan can make the most farfetched tasks achievable. This doesn’t just
                go for cycling but everyday life, if you want that pay raise don’t just try and
                become an ultra-productive employee the next day, come up with a plan to get
                you to a point you’re happy with and make small incremental changes each day.</p>
            <p>This was the most physically challenging thing
                I’ve ever done and I’m in no rush to do another Everest attempt any time soon.
