            <h1>Zwift Power Riders Analysis</h1>
            <p>December 7th, 2018</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.zwiftpower.com/events.php" target="_blank">Zwift Power</a> has become the goto site
                for
                anything Zwift racing related. From viewing events, to racing leaderboards they have it all. In addition
                to
                all this they also have a data on around 32,000 riders publicly available (only riders who opt in) so I
                took the
                liberty of looking into what kind of people are riding on Zwift</p>
            <p>*data only includes riders on the zwiftpower racing board</p>

                    <p>The Zwift community is mainly middle aged males, which doesn't surprise me based on my in-game
                        experience. While in game I rarely see female avatars, and based on the data on Zwift Power, the
                        number of females is almost negligable. This is a huge market opportunity for Zwift to grow
                        their user base, since female cycling has evolved and grown a lot in the past couple years. The
                        age range also comes as no surprise based on the topics being discussed on the in game chat.</p>

                    <p>No surprise here that GB and US are at the top of the leaderboard for most zwifters. What is
                        surprising, is the widespread adoption of zwift by Canadians. This can probably be attributed to
                        the fact that majority of Canadians can only ride outdoors 8-9 months (but 12 months if you're
                        hardcore). Another surprise is how slow adoption is among countries with strong cycling heritage
                        such as France, and Italy, although compared to other nations listed, they have relatively tame
                        winters.</p>

                    <p>It appears that the zwift population is a relatively fit bunch with an average ftp of 268 watts,
                        while weighing on average 76kgs. FTP is not nearly as corelated with weight as I would have
                        anticipated. In addition to this, it appears that many people are lying about their weight,
                        particularly those at 70kgs, as you can see by the large spike on the top bar plot of the Weight
                        vs FTP chart.</p>
